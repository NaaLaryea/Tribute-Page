                    WHO IS THE JOKER?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                    The Joker is a supervillain created by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Finger">Bill Finger</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kane">Bob Kane</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Robinson">Jerry Robinson</a> who first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman, published by DC Comics. 
                    He is a criminal mastermind and an expert chemist who uses weaponized props and toxins.
                    His first appearance was in <strong>Batman 1</strong>. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman.
                    In his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind. Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor; the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. 
                    <br>
                    <br>The Joker possesses no superhuman abilities, instead using his expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. 
                    The Joker sometimes works with other Gotham City supervillains, such as the Penguin and Two-Face, and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League, but these relationships often collapse due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos.

                    LESSONS ON THE JOKER AND WHY HE MOTIVATES ME
                    </h2>
                    <p>He is a genius who feels a wide range of emotions. He laughs, he cries, he gets angry and frustrated, and he even loves Harley Quinn in his own twisted way.
                        <br>
                        <br>The Joker is not afraid of anything, not even Batman.
                        <br>
                        <br>He plays by his own rules and does his own thing. He is the epitome of twisted thinking that solely exists on the dark side of the human psyche.
                        <br>
                        <br>He stays calm in high pressure situations. Whether he is trying to kill innocent people or getting his face smashed by Batman, the Joker always finds a reason to smile.
                        <br>
                        <br>Being prepared is better than having a plan. The Joker knows how to adapt to any surrounding and situation. And this comes from being prepared for the unknown.
                        <br>
                        <br>Conquer your fears. Being a fearless person, the Joker lives on the edge. When you become fearless, you experience a unique sense of freedom that wnables you achieve even the craziest dreams.
                        <br>
                        <br>Everybody needs a little push. The Joker prevented his true self from coming out and letting himself free until he pushed himself off the edge in his own sick way.
                        <br>
                        <br>Money doesn't equal happiness (as much as this is true, make enough money first before you talk this shit, lol). The Joker proves that money is not the solution to all of life's problems nor is it the root of all evil.
                        <br>
                        <br>Always enjoy life. Despite your goals in life and the various ups and downs that you would encounter throughout your existence, make sure to have fun with whatever life throws at you.
                        <br>
                        <br>Never give up. He has a tenacity that makes him persevere, and just like the Joker, when you put your mind into achieving a goal, make sure you see it through no matter what.
                        <br>
                        <br>Know your worth! This is perhaps the best advice you can take from the Joker. If you are a creative person or if you have a certain skill and you are really good at it, make sure you get rewarded accordingly. 
                        You deserve to get paid for doing the work that you have gained expertise through years of hardwork and dedication.
                        <br>
                        <br>Have a killer attitude. You aways need to have the perfect one-liners and catchphrases not only to give yourself a boost but also have a good comeback for your competitors and opponents.
